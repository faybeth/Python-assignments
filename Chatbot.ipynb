    "## Chatbot Program Using While Loop to Answer Questions About Data Science and AI\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple text based chatbot that answers questions about Data Science and Artificial Intelligence(AI).It uses the while loop to keep the conversation going until the user types 'exit'.\n",
    "- The different features used in the program are:\n",
    "1. It responds to keywords such as Data Science,AI,machine language,SQL,python.\n",
    "2. Uses the dictionaries for easy maintenance and if you want to add more knowledge one just adds a new entry to the response dictionary.\n",
    "3. It provides a default response when the chatbot doesn't understand the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of program is to demonstrate the use of while loops,the dictionaries and it also acts as a beginner friendly example that shows how a chatbot works.\n"
